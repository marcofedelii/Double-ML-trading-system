# Advanced Trading DLLs ‚Äì MT4 Integration

## Overview
This repository provides two proprietary DLLs designed to enhance algorithmic trading on MetaTrader 4 through external computation and modular architecture.

The libraries are:

- **`RFML.dll`** ‚Äì Machine Learning Module
Implements a Random Forest classifier for trade prediction based on live market features.

- **`AMM.dll`** ‚Äì Adaptive Money Management Module
Computes a dynamic risk multiplier using ensemble models (Random Forest + Linear Regression) to adjust trade exposure in real time.

Both DLLs are optimized for integration with Expert Advisors (EAs) and operate independently of the trading logic, ensuring separation of concerns and high modularity.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** Source code is not included. Only the compiled DLLs are distributed in this repository.

## Features

- Real-time computation from external libraries
- Designed for low-latency environments (MetaTrader 4)
- Seamless integration with Expert Advisors via `import` directives
- Built-in error handling and default fallback values
- Supports high-frequency tick-based invocation

## Installation

1. Copy `RFML.dll` and `AMM.dll` into your terminal‚Äôs `MQL4/Libraries/` folder
2. Ensure your Expert Advisor is correctly importing the DLLs
3. Enable DLL imports from MetaTrader terminal settings
4. Restart MetaTrader 4
